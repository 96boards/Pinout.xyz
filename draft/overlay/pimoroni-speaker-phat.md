#Speaker pHAT

Speaker pHAT crams an I2S DAC and mono amplifier, a tiny 8Î© 2W speaker, and a 10 LED bar graph all onto one teeny little pHAT. It's the neatest way to add audio to you Pi project, and its beautiful artwork evokes an 80s boombox!

Though designed to match the format of the Raspberry Pi Zero it is compatible with all 40-pin GPIO Raspberry Pi variants (2/B+/A+/Zero).

To get the pHAT DAC set up and ready to go you can use the one-line product installer:

```bash
curl -sS https://get.pimoroni.com/speakerphat | bash
```
